# Data Engineering E2E Project

## Domain: Health Care Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)
Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is the process that hospitals use to manage financial operations, from patient appointment scheduling to provider payment.

## Simplified Breakdown:
1. **Patient Visit**
   - Collection of patient details, insurance information, etc.
   - Determines who will cover the cost (hospital, clinic, doctor, insurance, medical aid, or the patient).

2. **Service Delivery**
   - The healthcare provider offers services to the patient.

3. **Billing Process**
   - The hospital generates a bill for the provided services.

4. **Claims Processing**
   - Insurance company reviews the bill.
   - Outcomes: Full payment, partial payment, or claim denial.

5. **Payments & Follow-ups**
   - If only a partial payment is made, the remaining balance is billed to the patient.
   - If the insurance denies the claim, the patient is responsible for the full amount.

6. **Tracking & Continuous Improvement**
   - Monitoring outstanding balances and optimizing the collection process.

## Key Aspects of RCM:
RCM ensures financial sustainability while maintaining quality care. Two critical components:
- **Accounts Receivable (AR)** - Focus of this project.
- **Accounts Payable (AP)**

### Challenges in Payment Collection:
- High patient financial responsibility due to:
  - Low insurance coverage.
  - Out-of-pocket payments for private clinics, dental treatments, and deductibles.

### Objectives for AR:
1. Maximize cash inflow.
2. Minimize the collection period (reduce the impact of inflation).

**Collection Probability Over Time:**
- 93% of money due within 30 days is collectible.
- 85% of money due within 60 days is collectible.
- 73% of money due within 90 days is collectible.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for AR:
### Benchmarks & Resources:
- [Healthcare AR Management](https://mdmanagementgroup.com/healthcare-accounts-receivable-management/)
- [Revenue Cycle KPIs](https://gentem.com/blog/revenue-cycle-kpis-definitions-and-benchmarks/)

**1. AR Aging (> 90 days):**
   - Example:
     - Total amount to collect: R1,000,000
     - Amount older than 90 days: R100,000
     - AR > 90 days = (R100,000 / R1,000,000) * 100 = **10%**

**2. Days in AR:**
   - Example:
     - R1,000,000 collected over 100 days
     - Per day collection rate: **R10,000**

## Data Engineering Tasks:
1. **Data Integration from Multiple Sources**
2. **ETL Pipeline Development** to create **fact and dimension tables** for reporting.
3. **Generate KPIs for Analysis**

### Datasets:
- **Electronic Medical Records (EMR) - Azure SQL Database**
  - Patients, Providers, Departments, Transactions, Encounters
  - **Sources:**
    - Hospital A: `techfiedsolutions-hospital-a`
    - Hospital B: `techfiedsolutions-hospital-b`

- **Claims Data - Insurance Company (Flat Files in Data Lake)**
  - Data uploaded monthly to the **Landing Zone**.

- **National Provider Identifier (NPI) - Public API**
  - Unique identifier for each doctor.

- **ICD Data - API Source**
  - Standardized system for mapping diagnosis codes and descriptions.

### Summary of Data Sources:
| Source | Format |
|--------|--------|
